## ðŸ“šEvaluation

> [!NOTE]
> 
> [GMAI-MMBench](https://uni-medical.github.io/GMAI-MMBench.github.io/), represents a pioneering benchmark specifically tailored for the medical domain, aimed at offering thorough assessments of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in diverse healthcare facets. Constructed from an extensive collection of 284 datasets sourced from both public repositories and hospitals, it encompasses a wide array of medical imaging modalitiesâ€”38 in totalâ€”as well as addresses 18 clinical-related tasks and spans across 18 departments within the healthcare sector. Additionally, the dataset incorporates 4 levels of perceptual granularity, all formatted in a Visual Question Answering (VQA) style to facilitate its use.
